<p>This article is about <b>open vs. private APIs.</b> For the web service specification, see OpenAPI Specification.
An open API (often referred to as a public API) is a publicly available application programming interface that provides developers with programmatic access to a proprietary software application or web service.[1][2] APIs are sets of requirements that govern how one application can communicate and interact with another. APIs can also allow developers to access certain internal functions of a program, although this is not typically the case for web APIs.
In the simplest terms, an API allows one piece of software
 to interact with another piece of software, whether within a single
  computer via a mechanism provided by the operating system or over an
  internal or external TCP/IP-based or non-TCP/IP-based network.</p><p style="margin-top:40px">In the late 2010s,
   many APIs are provided by organisations for access with HTTP. APIs may be used by
    both developers inside the organisation that published the API or by any developers
    outside that organisation who wish to register for access to the interface.</p>
